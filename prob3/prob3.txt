Prob. 3
(a) Number of nodes in the boundary of the hole centered at (6,1): 28
(b) The value of K^{50}(2,3) is K^{50}(2,3) = -1.2803e+00
    Hint. K(1,1) = 2.6338e+00
(c) The mean value of the temperature in the nodes, <u> = 2.9750e+01
    Hint. The maximum value of the temperature at the nodes is
          max u = 3.8340e+01
(d) The temperature for the point p of the element 37 with barycentric
    coordinates (0.25,0.25,0.5) is T = 3.7052e+01
    Hint. T(4,2) = 3.6732e+01
